# Applied projects:

- Student list app
  + This project was created for my ePorfolio. This project contains a Login page where client has to log in to have access to the database.  If there is no login credentials, the user must register and wait for approval from admin to have access.  Once access the user is able to create, read, update and delete a students data.  The data comes from a database where it stores all the critical information.  This project was created using java. [here](https://github.com/eortega21/portfolio)
- Partial Banking system.
  + This project is made with C++ using OOP (Object Oriented Programming). I was able to incorporate Encapsulating, Abstract, Inheritance, and polymorphism. This small program is able to use data structure to collect data and either remove or add a checking/savings account. In each account, we are able to increase or decrease the amount each object.  Project is available [here](https://github.com/eortega21/PartialBankSystem)
